# Simple C++ Linked List Implementation

This is a simple C++ implementation of a linked list data structure.
* THERE IS NO MAIN FOR THIS REPO. THESE ARE SIMPLY HEADER FILES FOR A LARGER IMPLEMENTATION OF YOUR CHOOSING.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Program uses g++ to compile.

### Installing

**LINUX**
* The program will compile with the 'g++' command.

**WINDOWS**
* You will need to download and install MinGW if you do not already have it. This is needed to run g++ on the Windows command line interface.
* After this is installed, you can use the same commands as the Linux instructions to get the program up and running.
